# HTTP Waifus

Waifus for every HyperText Transfer Protocol response [status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

> <https://httpwaifus.com>

HTTP Waifus is a collection of cute and funny anime images that more-or-less represent various HTTP status codes, inspired by the likes of [HTTP Cats](https://httpcats.com) and [HTTP Dogs](https://httpstatusdogs.com).
You can browse the images, or add some fun to your own site with the API, because even developers need some fun (and waifus?) in their lives üòù.

## Usage

Embed an image using the base URL `https://httpwaifus.com/{status_code}.jpeg`
and replace `{status_code}` with an HTTP status code.

```html
<img src="https://httpwaifus.com/418.jpeg" alt="418 I'm a teapot">
```
