# HTTP Waifus

Waifus for every HyperText Transfer Protocol response status code.

HTTP Waifus is a collection of cute and funny anime images that more-or-less represent various HTTP status codes, inspired by the likes of [HTTP Cats](https://httpcats.com) and [HTTP Dogs](https://httpstatusdogs.com).
You can browse the images, or add some fun to your own site with the API, because even developers need some fun (and waifus?) in their lives üòù.
Try the public demo [here](https://httpwaifus.deta.dev)!

## Usage

Embed an image using the base URL `https://httpwaifus.deta.dev/api/{status_code}`
and replace `{status_code}` with an HTTP status code.

```html
<img src="https://httpwaifus.deta.dev/api/418" alt="418 I'm a teapot">
```
