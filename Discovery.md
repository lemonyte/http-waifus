HTTP Waifus is a collection of cute and funny anime images that more-or-less represent various HTTP status codes, inspired by the likes of [HTTP Cats](https://httpcats.com) and [HTTP Dogs](https://httpstatusdogs.com).
You can browse the images, or add some fun to your own site with the API, because even developers need some fun (and waifus?) in their lives üòù.
